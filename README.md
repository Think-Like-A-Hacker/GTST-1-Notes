○ chmod u+x filename -> adding execute permission for user

○ chmod g+x filename -> adding execute permission for group

○ chmod o+x filename -> adding execute permission for other

          # Special File Permissions

  

- There are another 3 special permissions, you may encounter on your pentest

Journey.

- They are

- SUID bits(s) - set user ID bit - add 4 infront of our numeric value -> 4000

- SGID bits(S) - set group ID bit - add 2 infront of our numeric value -> 2777

- Sticky bits(t) - set other ID bit - add 1 in front of our numeric value -> 1602

- They are permissions like the execute(x), but they will set the execute permission to the

user who settled them.

- Example: if mr.A add suid bit to a program that program will be executed with permission

of mr.A

- Meaning if admin add suid bit on some program. Then any user if they got that program they can

run it as root with any sudo password

  

        # Package installation on linux

  

● ON linux to install softwares you use

package managers.

○ Ex: apt,pacman,pkg,...

● We will use debian package manager.

● On debian the package manager i called

‘APT’ also there is called ‘dpkg’

● Package managers are a free-software

user interface that work with an online

server to handle the installation and

removal of software on Debian, and

Debian-based Linux distributions.

  
  

        # Advanced package tool / apt /

  

● Apt is a free-software user interface that work with an

online server to handle the installation and removal of

software on Debian, and Debian-based Linux

distributions.used for online and offline purpose.

● The old ‘apt’ used as ‘apt-get’

● Syntax

○ sudo apt update

○ sudo apt search <softwarename>

○ sudo apt install <softwarename>

○ sudo apt remove <softwarename>

○ sudo apt upgrade

○ sudo apt purge <softwarename>

      #  Package dependencies

  

● A software can be built based on another program

called ‘modules’

● SO, a program to work properly, the dependencies have

to be installed successfully.

● Those package managers install the

software+dependencies.

  

      # Dpkg / Debian package manager /

  

● Dpkg is an offline package managing

program.

● Packages on debian have an extension

“.deb”

● Syntax

○ sudo dpkg -i <packagename>

○ sudo dpkg -r <packagename>

○ sudo dpkg -P <packagename>
